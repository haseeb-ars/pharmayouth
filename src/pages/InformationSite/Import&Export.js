        </p>
<h3>Why Import & Export Services Matter</h3>
<p>Access to vital medicines is not always guaranteed. Licensing restrictions, supply chain disruptions, regional approvals, and product discontinuations can limit the availability of life-saving or life-enhancing treatments in many countries.</p>
<h3>PharmaYouth plays a critical role in ensuring continuity of care by facilitating:</h3>
<p> üî¥ Import of medicines into the UK under UK regulations for unlicensed medicines<br></br>

üî¥ Export of UK-sourced pharmaceuticals to healthcare providers and distributors worldwide<br></br>

üî¥ Specialist sourcing of difficult-to-access or discontinued products</p>

<h2>UK Import of Unlicensed Medicines</h2>
<p>If a medicine is not licensed in the UK but is essential to a patient‚Äôs treatment, PharmaYouth can lawfully import it from international markets under MHRA guidance. We handle:</p>

3. Cold chain and temperature-sensitive handling<br></br>
